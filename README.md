# Puppy Play Date Application
In this project, our team created a full-stack app combining the idea of puppies and owner match-making. The user signs up by creating an account on the login page. The user can then sign-in to fill out their puppy profile. This information is placed in a back-end database using MySql, Sequelize(orm) and Javacript. The database allows the app to run the user provided info through our pre-created 'fake' puppy data and match them with the perfect puppy play date!
